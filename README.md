True square waves are a special class of rectangular waves with 50% duty cycle. Varying the duty cycle of a rectangular wave leads to pulse width modulation, where the information is conveyed by changing the duty-cycle of each transmitted rectangular wave. A true square wave can be simply generated by applying signum function over a periodic function.
g(t) = sgn[sin(2*pi*f*t)]

The number of terms of its Fourier Series expansion, taken for approximating the square wave is often seen as Gibbs phenomenon, which manifests as ringing effect at the corners of the square wave in time domain.

Digital signals are graphically represented as square waves with certain symbol/bit period. Square waves are also used universally in switching circuits, as clock signals synchronizing various blocks of digital circuits, as reference clock for a given system domain and so on.
